### Contents of the link

- Two real-world subsets
- One synthetic dataset
- Pretrained checkpoints
- Other related resources

### Notes

- The environments used to train TPENet SWIN-B and TPENet SWIN-S were lost.
- The TPENet SWIN-L model was retrained on a rebuilt environment (see `requirements.txt` from the MS<sup>3</sup>PE repository).
- The datasets split files are also included in this repository.
- Several real images in the two real-world subsets have been updated compared to those used in the paper:
  - Some inappropriate boundaries were corrected.
  - Both the old and new versions are stored in the shared link.

### Updated Evaluation

We evaluated the updated real datasets using our models. The results for **OB-DIODE** and **OB-EntitySeg** are shown below:

#### OB-DIODE

| Method | ODS  | OIS  | AP   |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| SWIN-L |      |      |      |
| SWIN-B |      |      |      |
| SWIN-S |      |      |      |

#### OB-EntitySeg

| Method | ODS  | OIS  | AP   |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| SWIN-L |      |      |      |
| SWIN-B |      |      |      |
| SWIN-S |      |      |      |
